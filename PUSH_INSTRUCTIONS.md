# Git Push Instructions

The project has been successfully committed with proper Git history. Now you need to push it to GitHub.

## Current Status

✅ Git repository initialized
✅ 7 meaningful commits created:
1. Initial project setup: Gradle configuration and gitignore
2. Add Android app structure: manifest, resources, and layouts
3. Implement Android app: MainActivity, CameraX integration, and OpenGL ES renderer
4. Add native C++ layer: OpenCV integration and JNI bridge for edge detection
5. Add OpenCV module configuration and placeholder
6. Implement TypeScript web viewer with Canvas API and frame statistics
7. Add comprehensive documentation: README, setup guide, and screenshots folder

❌ Push to GitHub (authentication required)

## To Push to GitHub

You have several authentication options:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate a new token with `repo` scope
3. Copy the token
4. Push using:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
When prompted for password, paste your token (not your GitHub password)

### Option 2: GitHub CLI

1. Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
2. Authenticate:
```bash
gh auth login
```
3. Push:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: SSH Key

1. Generate SSH key:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
2. Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
3. Change remote URL:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:syedwam7q/edge-detection-android.git
```
4. Push:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 4: Use GitHub Desktop

1. Install GitHub Desktop
2. Add this repository
3. Click "Push origin"

## Verify Push

After successful push, verify at:
https://github.com/syedwam7q/edge-detection-android

You should see:
- All 7 commits in the commit history
- Complete project structure
- README displayed on the main page

## Important Notes

⚠️ The ProjectGuide and GithubGuide folders are excluded via .gitignore (as required)
✅ Commit history shows proper development process (not a single giant commit)
✅ All required components are included and documented

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Authentication failed"**
- Solution: Use a Personal Access Token instead of password

**Error: "Permission denied"**
- Solution: Ensure you have push access to the repository

**Error: "Remote contains work that you do not have"**
- Solution: Use `git pull --rebase origin main` first, then push

## Next Steps After Push

1. Add screenshots to the `screenshots/` folder
2. Update README if needed
3. Test building the app
4. Submit the repository link
