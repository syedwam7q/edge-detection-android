## 🚀 Access Instructions

### 1. Web Browser
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. Test Features
- Click **"📷 Load Sample Frame"** → Should show enhanced room scene with edges
- Click **"📁 Upload Image"** → Test with your own images
- Check **Frame Statistics** → Should show: 800x600, 20.0 FPS, 35.50ms, timestamp

### 3. Expected Output
You should see:
- Purple gradient header "🎨 Edge Detection Viewer"
- Black canvas with white edge-detected room scene
- Green text: "Enhanced Edge Detection" and "CLAHE + Canny(50/150) + Morphology"
- Stats panel showing resolution, FPS, processing time
- About section with enhanced algorithm details

## 🆘 Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Clear browser cache**: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. **Check console**: F12 → Console tab for JavaScript errors
3. **Restart server**: 
   ```bash
   lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill
   npm run serve
   ```
4. **Rebuild TypeScript**:
   ```bash
